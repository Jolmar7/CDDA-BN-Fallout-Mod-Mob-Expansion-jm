A mod that adds several fallout inspired items, mobs, locations and a few NPCs and NPC locations. Inspired by Tefnut's Fallout: New England Expansion.

I have decided to upload another mod, this one being an expansion to Tefnut's wonderful Fallout: New England mod he made for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead some time ago. I have immense respect for Tefnut as a mod creator, and felt like he established a great foundation for integrating various monsters, items and locations from the Fallout universe into Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead Bright Nights. To add further content to his mod, I elected to add more mobs, locations, items and NPCs/NPC factions to his own mod to flesh out content somewhat, and to make fallout-esque encounters more common in the post Cataclysm Wasteland that was New England

In particular, this mod adds:

-1 new firearm

-4 new melee weapons

-1 new grenade

-2 new items

-3 new articles of clothing

-1 New wasteland town with a variety of missions and merchants

-26 new locations (including three kinds of vaults, the most common one having a semi-random layout and one of eight vault experiments at random).

-9 new professions

-3 new NPC factions (Friendly vault dwellers, New California Republic and Caesar's Legion)

-28 new NPC missions

-28 new mobs to fight in the New England Wasteland (including 7 new robots!)
